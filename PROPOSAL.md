# CS 126 Final Project Proposal

### Project Description
#### Game Description
For my CS 126 final project, I hope to create a simple rougelike game through cinder. 
Ideally, the game will have a few randomly generated levels with enemies the player needs
to defeat or avoid and items the player can pick up and use.
Each level will be a maze of rooms connected together, and the player can move around with WASD to navigate within and between rooms.
The player will be able to use inventory items and interact with enemies through the keyboard.
If a player loses all of their health, the game ends and a new run must be started.
#### Game Plot (still needs to be refined)
The Intergalactic Human Empire (WIP NAME) suddently collapsed in the year 6210 after failed research on immortality backfired (WIP).
The player is the child of a long generation of scientists who continued to conduct immortality research and finally succeeded in the year 6621.
When news of this breakthrough spread, human remnants and alien civilizations attacked the research facility in hopes of gaining the secrets of immortality.
In their final desperation, the player's parents injected the serum (?) into the player and hid the player deep underground to be raised by AI.
After leaving the underground facility, the player spent thousands of years as an intergalactic fugitive who hoped to undo their immortality. 
The game itself is set in the year 12600 after the player finally discovered how to undo their immortality, but is the last human in the universe.
Now, the player hopes to return to Earth one last time, but alien civilizations that want to capture and research the player stand in the way.

### Background Knowledge / Motivation
I really enjoy playing roguelike games where the player can explore and collect items, getting stronger in the process.
They are lots of fun because of their intense gameplay and replayablility.
I have played many before and am excited to create a very basic version of one for the final project.
I am also a big fan of science fiction, and want to possibly tell a story through game components.
### Rough Timeline
#### Week1
For the first week of this project, I hope to finish the story and begin coding the individual components required for the game.
This means implementing important classes and the object decomposition: rooms, players, enemies, items.
Each class should have information about how to be visualized through cinder and methods to interact with other classes.
I want to begin on a very basic game engine that handles just a player within a room.
I hope that by this week, I have a very basic game engine and cinder application where a player can move through hardcoded rooms with keyboard inputs.
#### Week2
For the second week of the project, I hope to expand on the game engine, allowing a player to interact with hard coded items and enemies placed within the room.
I also want to spend this week creating a variety of enemies and items the player may encounter.
#### Week3
For the third week of the project, I hope to move away from hard coded rooms and enemies and instead focus on random generation that makes sense. 

### Stretch Goals
* Include boss enemies.
* Add puzzles.
* Add animations / cutscenes between levels/rooms  
* Allow for player to save and load games.
